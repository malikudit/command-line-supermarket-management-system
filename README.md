# Supermarket Database Management System
A simple C++ based command-line interface database management program that manages the system administration of a bank. The program offers account management functionality with two different levels of secure access, for users and for administrators. The program also includes miscellaneous functionality like printing invoices, and recording the total net flow of funds for any given organization in the banking database.

Built as my final project in my senior year of high school at Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram.
